kippo-frankenstein
==================

My attempt to merge all kippo forks/features I find useful into one repo.

Forked from: https://github.com/micheloosterhof/kippo

Extra Code merged from (or will be):

https://github.com/g0tmi1k/kippo-patches

https://github.com/toringe/kippomutate

https://github.com/basilfx/kippo-extra

https://github.com/rep/hpfeeds/tree/master/appsupport/kippo


When this acutally works I'll create a real readme. Until that time, don't use this. Really.

Changes
=======

1. 06-25-2014 Removed "logoff" trick, honeypot just exists cleanly on user logout
2. 06-2-2014 Merged hpfeeds support and added appropriate kippo.cfg entry (https://github.com/rep/hpfeeds/tree/master/appsupport/kippo
)
